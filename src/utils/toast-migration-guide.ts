/**
 * TOAST MIGRATION GUIDE
 *
 * The toast system has been updated to support both `type` and `variant` properties.
 * 
 * For all toast calls in your codebase that are causing TypeScript errors:
 * 
 * 1. SIMPLE SOLUTION: Replace `variant` with `type` in your toast calls
 *    
 *    Before:
 *    ```
 *    toast({
 *      title: "Success",
 *      description: "Operation completed successfully",
 *      variant: "success"
 *    });
 *    ```
 *    
 *    After:
 *    ```
 *    toast({
 *      title: "Success",
 *      description: "Operation completed successfully",
 *      type: "success"
 *    });
 *    ```
 *
 * 2. IMPORTANT NOTE FOR "destructive" VARIANT:
 *    If you're using the "destructive" variant, replace it with the "error" type:
 *    
 *    Before:
 *    ```
 *    toast({
 *      title: "Error",
 *      description: "Something went wrong",
 *      variant: "destructive"
 *    });
 *    ```
 *    
 *    After:
 *    ```
 *    toast({
 *      title: "Error",
 *      description: "Something went wrong",
 *      type: "error" 
 *    });
 *    ```
 *
 * 3. You can also continue using `variant` by updating your toast imports:
 *    ```
 *    import { useToast, toast, ToastProps } from "@/components/ui/use-toast";
 *    ```
 *
 * This should resolve the TypeScript errors related to the toast component.
